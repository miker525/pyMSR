An easy to use, fully functional Magnetic Strip Card Reader/Encoder library for use in python 2.7

Currently this software is in development and is not completed. However I am going to be working on this as often as I can to ensure it's completion in a timely fashion. 

pyMSR is being designed and tested with the MSR605 MagStripe reader/encoder but should be fully functional with similar MagStripe utilities like the MSR606, MSR206 and others. However I do not have the utilities to test with these machines. Community feedback with these machines would be more than greatful.

pyMSR originated as a fork of libMSR605 by Louis Bodnar (https://github.com/pezmanlou/msr605). However since we broke off the vast majority of his code has been removed, improved or redone by myself. For comparison please check out his repository shared above.
